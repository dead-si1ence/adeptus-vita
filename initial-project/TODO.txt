- Choose any imbalanced dataset --DONE

- Apply any needed preprocessing 
    1. openCV
    2. numpy
    3. matplotlib

- Apply Resampling on this dataset (both undersampling then oversampling ) --DONE

- Choose Two Ensemble models ( one Bagging and one boosting ) --DONE

- Train each model on the processed data --DONE

- Calculate Accuracy, Precision, Recall, f1-score and AUC for each model --DONE

- Optimize the two models by choose different parameters to get better results --DONE

- Calculate Accuracy, Precision, Recall, f1-score and AUC for each model for the optimized models

- Submit The Code (.py or .ipynb)

- Work on Groups (Only Two or three is allowed for each group, don't work alone)

- Their will be a discussion for your code
